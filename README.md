  - a User model pre-populated with relevant Bcrypt methods 
  - a rake db:yolo which creates, migrates, and seeds your database
  - a rake db:fuckit which drops, creates, migrates and seeds your database
  - a rake db:console which puts you into a psql session
  - a rake console which puts you into an irb session loaded with access to the models
  - faker gem already required
  - carrierwave gem/environment present but commented out
